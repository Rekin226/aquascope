"""The per-role model call: compact JSON in, a JSON object out, tokens and USD counted per role.

Every role of the crew that uses a model uses it the same way: one stateless
call with a system prompt and a compact JSON context, never a transcript. The
reply is expected to be one JSON object (a fenced block is accepted). Errors
and unparseable replies come back as ``None`` and the role falls back to its
keyless behaviour; nothing here raises on the model's account.

The transport is the one ``aquascope.ai_engine`` already has (OpenAI-style
chat completions, the Anthropic translation, the browser path through
urllib), reached through ``team._model_for`` so a provider, a model name, a
key, a base URL or a ready client resolve exactly as they do for ``solve``.
The transport counts the tokens per role in ``ws.ledger``; the cost is
computed here after every call from the ledger's token deltas at the model's
rate (:data:`aquascope.ai_engine.providers.PRICES`) and kept as
``ws.ledger[role]["cost_usd"]``. A spend ceiling (``max_usd``) stops the
calls, not the crew: once ``ws.total_usd`` reaches it, one event and
``ws.budget`` say so, every later call returns ``None`` and the roles fall
back to their keyless behaviour, so the study still ends in a consistent
workspace and a bundle.
